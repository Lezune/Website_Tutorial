# Website_Tutorial
This is my website tutorial. The point of this project is to familiarize myself
with Cascading Style Sheets and other web development tools to further myself as
a developer. The plan is to build a template for an online portfolio as well as
show my progress leading up to the end result.

I am testing out my webpage via a local server by using XAMPP before committing
to a hosting service. I am currently using Atom for my IDE when building with
CSS and HTML. The hope is not only increase my experience with these web
development tools, but also build organization skills that will ease and quicken
the development process.
